## Final Project

For the R portion of the final, you will have two tasks. The first task is to replicate the plot below using the census dataset from the openintro package. (HINT: It does use one of the themes from the ggthemes package.)

![Income by Gender](images/gender_income.jpg)

```{r}
#Insert Your Code Here
```

Your second task is to conduct a two-sample t-test to determine if there is a difference in pay (total\_personal\_income) between males and females. Note that your test should include a written conclusion in statistical and practical terms. \
